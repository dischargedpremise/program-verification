# Program Verification Methods, Tools, and Experiments
Our aim is to create a repository of examples and reasonably advanced content covering different aspects of program verification. We hope this will serve motivated students, teachers, and anyone interested in learning and using formal verification techniques. The inspiration for this effort comes in its purest form from [Verified software: theories, tools, experiments][http://vstte.ethz.ch/pdfs/vstte-hoare-misra.pdf].

## What is program verification?
*Program verification* refers to the application of mathematical proof techniques to establish the correctness of a program with respect to a formal specification of the desired behavior. Thanks to the engineering efforts of so many researchers, quite a few excellent program verifiers are available today. Automated program verification is possible now in practical settings. 

## Our approach
We try to balance between theory and practice. We will introduce and discuss just enough theory required to understand and experiment with the examples found here. We direct you to excellent resources, technical publications, and text books that cover many aspects in greater depth. Most of the examples found here can be directly checked using state of the art tools.

## Tools
We use [Dafny programming language and the verifier][https://github.com/Microsoft/dafny] to write and check our programs. Dafny comes from Microsoft Research. It is freely available for academic and research purposes. You can also [try Dafny online][http://rise4fun.com/dafny/]. 

## The associated blog
The blog posts at [dischargedpremise][http://unthought.in] may discuss some of the examples in this repository. We will appreciate contributions in the form of notes, more examples, and such.

## Contributing to this repository
We follow [GitHub flow][https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/] for growing the content here. Please consider joining our effort in creating open content for learning and using program verification techniques.
